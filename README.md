# LibGDX Starter Project

This repository is intended to remove the need to write the classes that basically every game is going to need to contain. It was initially generated using the [BadLogic libgdx Setup App](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) with a desktop and android module with no extra libraries selected. If you need access to libraries like Box2D and do not know how to install them post project generation then this tool is available for you to use and if you still feel like this starter project works for what you plan to build then you can just copy these files over.

This repository is not intended to be a one size fits all solution. Projects that this may not fit perfectly with include:

+ Projects where you intend to use Event-Driven input handling
+ If you need Box2D or other libraries and do not know how to install them post project generation

## Planned Additions

+ Data-Oriented Particle System
+ Game Data Provider
+ Sound Manager
